# Unofficial Hack Hour API docs

This is where the OpenAPI spec file for the Hack Hour API is being hosted at the moment before upstreamed.

## Using the spec

You can see the rendered API docs at [Swagger Editor (next version)][swagger-editor]
or [SwaggerHub] and try calling them, although since CORS is not yet enabled, you may want to use the latter.

[swagger-editor]: https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreijiroh-dev/hackclub-scrapbook-log/main/scraps/hackhour-api-docs/openapi.yaml
[SwaggerHub]: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/recaptime-dev/hack-hour/3.0.0

You can use [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), either via the web editor or by downloading the tool [per the docs]
